Project Overview
This project aims to predict student performance (final grade G3) using machine learning. It utilizes a Random Forest Regressor to analyze various features related to students' academic and demographic backgrounds. The model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared Score (RÂ²).

Dataset
The dataset includes multiple attributes influencing student performance. The target variable is G3 (Final Grade), and categorical variables are encoded before training the model.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)
Seaborn & Matplotlib (for data visualization)
Scikit-learn (for model training and evaluation)

Installation & Usage
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
